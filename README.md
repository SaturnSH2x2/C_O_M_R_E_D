# C_O_M_R_E_D
Open source theme-able comic reader for the 3DS.  

In it's current state, this homebrew is unusable.  The app crashes when exiting a comic and opening another comic.  Only a theme named "test" is loaded from the SD Card (and it has totally unstylish design choices).  The code's a complete and utter mess.  Do NOT expect this to be a release of any sort.  However, if you want to try it out anyways, you'll need to compile it.
